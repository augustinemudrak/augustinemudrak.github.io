This project is my version of Tic Tac Toe with a bit a humor and character added. The first player is X and the second player is O, when player one clikcs of one of the boxes then that corresponding box will be filled with an X and then the following player goes and after a different box is clicked then that box will be filled with an O the two players play until a player gets three of their Xs or Os in a row or diagonal.

There is also music that auto plays when the page opens and loops over but in the controls for the song near the top of the page the song could be lowered or muted.

since I did not have enough time there are two main drawbacks in my program. One, there is no reset button after a player wins so they must refreash their page. Second, there is no background transparency when the winning or tie image is shown.

If you want to contact me with any comments or yyou have a better way to do things in my program then hit my email: augustinemudrak@gmail.com.

Thank you and have fun,
